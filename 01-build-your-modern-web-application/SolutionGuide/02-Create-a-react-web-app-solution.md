## **Challenge 2: Create a React Web App**

  To create a React Web App, run the following commands from the [root](./) folder of the project.
  Open the terminal in VS Code using the WSL distribution of your choice. from the project root folder   type:
  
  `npx create-react-app cloudastro-react-app`
  
  The following output is shown:

  This can take a minute or two.
  So we can now change into cloudastro-react-app and start a pre-build version of this app locally.
  
  When the setup of react web app is finished, the following output is shown:
  
  ![image](./.images/12-react-app-result.png)
  
  `cd cloudastro-react-app`
  
  `npm start`
  
  This brings up the React Web App to your default browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

  Now we can make some changes to the React Web App to align with the MicroHack.
  For that we are going to change the file App.js in the created folder [./cloudastro-react-app/src/App.js](./cloudastro-react-app/src/App.js)

  The result is shown like this:

  We are ready for a deployment, sice this web page only exist for demonstration of the possibilities.
