# **01 Build your modern web application - MicroHack**

## **Introduction**

This hack is designed to help you get hands-on experience with publishing a modern web application to Microsoft Azure in three different ways:

- as an Azure Static Web App
- as an App Service
- as a containerized installation

## **Learning Objectives**

In this hack you will learn how to use Bicep to deploy infrastructure to Azure, how to build a CI/CD pipeline in GitHub to deploy the web app, and get an overview of the differnt ways of hosting the web app in Azure.
This lab is not a full explanation of preparing a development workstation, please consider the following articles required pre-reading to build foundational knowledge.
