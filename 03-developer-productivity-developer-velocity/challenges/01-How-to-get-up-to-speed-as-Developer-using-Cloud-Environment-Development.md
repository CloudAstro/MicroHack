# Challenge 1 - How to get up to speed as Developer using Cloud Environment Development

## Introduction

There are several approaches to increase development efficiency and developer productivity. In this Microhack, we'll be concentrating on cutting down on setup time for projects, tools, code editors, and even extensions so that we may jump right into the coding section in!

If hybrid or remote, does not play a role anymore. Everyone will work in the same environment and no matter how many different project you work on,
you can have as many instances of Cloud environment development.

Instead of installing every required tool/software in your machine, we will be using Microsoft Dev Box to setup the project once and thats it! every other team member will be ready to start coding in no time!
