# Challenge 1 - How to get up to speed as Developer

## Introduction

There are many ways to improve developing speed and be more productive as a developer. In this Microhack we are going to be focusing to eliminate the time it takes to setup the project, neccesary tools, code editor and even extensions and jumping directly on the code part in!
Instead of installing every bit of required tool/software in your machine, we will be using Microsoft Dev Box to setup the project once and thats it! every other team member will be ready to start coding in no time!

## Goal 

The goal of this challenge is to setup Microsoft Dev Box and prepare for the first use

### Task 1: Create a Dev Box

Login to your microsoft account [https://aka.ms/devbox](https://aka.ms/devbox/)

- Create a Dev Center
- Create a Dev Box Definition
- Create a Project
- Create a Network Connection 
- Create a Dev Box pool
- Manage access

### Task 2: Prepare the development environment

Now that we have everything set up its time to prepare the environment to start coding.

- Install an IDE/Code Editor (for this microhack Visual Studio Code)
- We are going to write simple html as example for this microhack so no need to install other tools for now.

#### Note! In your real project
