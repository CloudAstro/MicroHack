# Challenge 3 - Deploy on Azure App Service

## Introduction

After you have finished our project, now we can deploy our app in Azure App Service in only a few stepps. 

## Goal 

The goal of this challenge is to have or at least one of our React apps deployed on Azure App Service and running.


### Task 1: Install the Azure extension in VS Code

You have the option to install the whole azure package (incl. App Service) 

### Task 2: Create a new App Service

We have here two Options. We can create a new App Service through VS Code or through Azure web app (in this microhack we covered only the VS Code method in the solution guide)

### Task 3: Deploy

Now you need to deploy the React app. Again we have 2 ways of doing it: through VS Code or Azure web app (in this microhack we covered only the VS Code method in the solution guide)

## Challenge Completed if

The app is successfully deployed in Azure App Service
