# Challenge 2 - Comparison between Microsoft Dev Box and GitHub Codespaces

## Introduction

There are also alternatives when it comes to Cloud Environment Development. 
In this challenge you will be coding in two different Cloud environment development tools (Microsoft Dev Box & Github Codespaces)
and explore the benifits which fit to your project best. 


You have a scenario where your company has a new project which needs to be done in Java Spring Boot. The Developers who will be working on that project
are seperated, and do not have the neccessary tools to start working on a java project. 

You need to configure the cloud environment development so that everyone can start coding imediately.
