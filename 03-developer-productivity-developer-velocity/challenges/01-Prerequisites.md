# Prerequisites

In order to use the MicroHack time most effectively, the following tasks should be completed prior to starting the session: 

- Azure Subscription 

- Github account 

- Basic knowledge in coding (JavaScript for this Microhack) 

With these pre-requisites in place, we can focus directly developing, rather than spending hours repeating relatively simple tasks such as setting up localy everything by yourself.
