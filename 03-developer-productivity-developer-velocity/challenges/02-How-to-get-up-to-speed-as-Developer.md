# Challenge 1 - How to get up to speed as Developer

## Introduction

There are many ways to improve developing speed and be more productive as a developer. In this Microhack we are going to be focusing to eliminate the time it takes to setup the project, neccesary tools, code editor and even extensions and jumping directly on the code part in!
Instead of installing every bit of required tool/software in your machine, we will be using Microsoft Dev Box to setup the project once and thats it! every other team member will be ready to start coding in no time!

## Goal 

The goal of this challenge is to setup Microsoft Dev Box and prepare for the first use

### Task 1: Create a Dev Box

Login to your microsoft account [https://aka.ms/devbox](https://aka.ms/devbox/)

### Task 2: Prepare the development environment
