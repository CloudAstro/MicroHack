**Probably your Dev box lsit is empty, so you need to create one just like the dev center click on "Create" on top of the page**

**Then you need to setup the definition by giving the name, image and computing. Then click on "Create"**

**Note!** You can create [custom images](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/how-to-configure-azure-compute-gallery) with preinstalled tools (out of the scope of this microhack)
