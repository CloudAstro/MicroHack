## MicroHack introduction and context

In order to start working on a software project, a developer needs to first set up a development environment containing all the tools, libraries, dependencies and configuration necessary before the actual work can begin. This process is cumbersome, frustrating and very time-consuming. 

This MicroHack scenario walks through the use of modern dev tools  to help you to improve your productivity as a developer with a focus on the best practices and the design principles.  

This lab is not a full explanation of the complete tool set, please consider the following articles required pre-reading to build foundational knowledge. 

What is a Cloud Environment Development 

Why would we use the Cloud Environment for Development 

 

If you want to take your knowledge deeper than what will be explained here, we recommand reading: 
Github Codespaces or/and  Microsoft Dev Box 

## Objectives

After completing this MicroHack you will: 

- Understand how to be more productive as a developer  

- Understand How Development Environment can improve productivity 

- know the basics of Cloud Environment Development 

## Prerequisites

In order to use the MicroHack time most effectively, the following tasks should be completed prior to starting the session: 

- Azure Subscription (Optional) 

- Github account 

- Basic knowledge in coding (React for this microhack) 

- Visual Studio Code installed on your machine (For local cloud environment) 

 

With these pre-requisites in place, we can focus directly developing, rather than spending hours repeating relatively simple tasks such as setting up localy everything by yourself. 

## Lab environment for this MicroHack 

All you need in order to follow is a browser, Visual Studio Code 

## Challenges

### Challenge 1 - How to get up to speed as Developer 

 

#### Goal 

The goal of this exercise is how to eliminate the installation libraries, dependencies and configuration necessary before the actual work can begin using Github codespaces 

 

#### Task 1: Open Github Codespaces 

Github offers 60 hours free usage if codespaces and thats what we are gonna select "Start for free" for learning purposes, you can then check the pricing for you purposes.
