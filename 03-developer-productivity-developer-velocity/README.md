# **03 Developer Productivity/Developer Velocity**

## Introduction

In order to start working on a software project, a developer needs to first set up a development environment containing all the tools, libraries, dependencies and configuration necessary before the actual work can begin. This process is cumbersome, frustrating and very time-consuming. 

This MicroHack scenario walks through the use of modern dev tools  to help you to improve your productivity as a developer with a focus on the best practices and the design principles.  

This lab is not a full explanation of the complete tool set, please consider the following articles required pre-reading to build foundational knowledge. 

[What is a Cloud Environment Development](https://www.cloudshare.com/virtual-it-labs-glossary/cloud-development-environment/) 

[Why would we use the Cloud Environment for Development](https://www.itprotoday.com/development-techniques-and-management/who-needs-or-doesn-t-need-cloud-ides) 

 

If you want to take your knowledge deeper than what will be explained here, we recommand reading: 
[Github Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces) or/and  [Microsoft Dev Box](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/) 


## Learning Objectives

After completing this MicroHack you will: 

- Understand how to be more productive as a developer  

- Understand How Development Environment can improve productivity 

- know the basics of Cloud Environment Development

- [Challenge 2: Comparison between Microsoft Dev Box and GitHub Codespaces](challenges/02-Comparison-between-Microsoft-Dev-Box-and-Github-Codespaces.md)
- [Challenge 3: Deploy on Azure App Service](challenges/03-Deploy-on-Azure-App-Service.md)

## Prerequisites

In order to use the MicroHack time most effectively, the following tasks should be completed prior to starting the session: 

- Azure Subscription 

- Github account 

- Basic knowledge in coding (JavaScript for this Microhack) 

With these pre-requisites in place, we can focus directly developing, rather than spending hours repeating relatively simple tasks such as setting up localy everything by yourself.
