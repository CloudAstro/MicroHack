# Challenge 4 - Optimize for async access patterns

## Introduction

Asynchronous programming is becoming increasingly important in modern software development, especially as applications scale in size and complexity. Using external tools and services, such as message queues, can help to optimize application performance and improve scalability and fault tolerance.

One such tool is Azure Service Bus, which provides a message queuing service that allows components to communicate asynchronously. By implementing patterns such as request-reply and event-driven architectures, application components can be decoupled and communication can become more flexible and scalable.

In this context, integrating with Azure Service Bus can help to optimize applications and improve their overall performance and reliability.

## Goal 

The goal of this challenge is to optimize a NestJS application for async access patterns using Azure Service Bus, specifically by implementing the request-reply pattern. The completed solution should improve the application's performance, scalability, and fault tolerance, while also ensuring robustness and reliability through thorough testing and documentation.

### Task 1: Configure Azure Service Bus

- Sign in to the Azure portal and create a new Azure Service Bus namespace.
- Create a new queue in your Azure Service Bus namespace.
- Generate a connection string for your Azure Service Bus namespace.
- Update your NestJS app's configuration with the Azure Service Bus connection string.

### Task 2: Implement request-reply pattern using Azure Service Bus

- Create a new MessageQueue service that uses the @azure/service-bus package to send and receive messages using Azure Service Bus.
- Update your movies controller to use the MessageQueue service to send requests to your movies service.
- Update your movies service to use the MessageQueue service to send and receive messages asynchronously using the request-reply pattern.
- Update your movies controller to wait for the response from the movies service before returning a result.

### Task 3: Implement event-driven pattern using Azure Service Bus

- Update your movies service to emit events when movies are created, updated, or deleted.
- Create a new MovieEventHandler service that listens for events on your Azure Service Bus namespace.
- Update your MovieEventHandler service to update your movies database when events are received.


## Challenge Completed if

- The NestJS application has been updated to use async access patterns with Azure Service Bus.
- The request-reply pattern has been implemented using Azure Service Bus for communication between application components.
- The application's performance has been validated and demonstrates improved scalability and fault tolerance compared to the previous synchronous implementation.
