# Challenge 3 - Improve API efficiency

## Introduction

Switching from a REST API to a GraphQL API can provide significant benefits in terms of CPU and memory usage. GraphQL's query optimization and selective field retrieval can greatly reduce the amount of data retrieved from a server, resulting in faster response times and lower resource consumption. 

In this challenge, we will explore switching to a GraphQL API with ease using nestjs.

## Goal 

The goal of this challenge is to successfully switch an existing app from a REST API to a GraphQL API, optimizing its performance and reducing CPU and memory usage.

### Task 1: Install the necessary dependencies

 - `@nestjs/graphql`
 - `@nestjs/apollo` 
 - `@apollo/server graphql`

### Task 2: Manage access

After you have created your dev box now you should manage the access and invite team members to your dev box.
For now You can assign yourself as a developer and/or administrator.

#### Note! the setup is done once only by the owner of the dev box and as a developer chances are you are not going to configure anything yourself

## Challenge Completed if

- Dev box is ready for use
