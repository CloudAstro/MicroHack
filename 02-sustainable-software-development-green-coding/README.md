# **Sustainable Software Development Green Coding - MicroHack**

## Introduction

This hack is designed to help you get familiar with Sustainable Software development practices also known as Green Coding.

### Eight principles of Sustainable Software Engineering
There are eight principles to Sustainable Software Engineering that form a shared understanding of what it means to develope Sustainable Software.

1. *Carbon*: Build applications that are carbon efficient.

2. *Electricity*: Build applications that are energy-efficient.

3. *Carbon Intensity*: Consume electricity with the lowest carbon intensity.

4. *Embodied Carbon*: Build applications that are hardware efficient.

5. *Energy Proportionality*: Maximize the energy efficiency of hardware.

6. *Networking*: Reduce the amount of data and distance it must travel across the network.

7. *Demand Shaping*: Build carbon-aware applications.

8. *Optimization*: Focus on step-by-step optimizations that increase the overall carbon efficiency.

These eight principles are independent of:

Application domain.

Organization size or type.

Cloud vendor or self-hosted.

Programming language or framework.

This hack covers a first introduction to apply those rules to an existing application and improve the caron footprint.

## Learning Objectives

In this hack you will learn how to set up a containerized regional-available movie API application on traditional Azure Virtual machines while going through the hack you will apply two optimizations to the application and lear about different patterns.

You will also use the Carbon Aware SDK to run your application in a region consuming the lowest carbon emissions this will help your applications footprint.

As the last step you're going to move the application away from the traditional IaaS environment to the Azure Container Apps PaaS service to further reduce the maintenance.
