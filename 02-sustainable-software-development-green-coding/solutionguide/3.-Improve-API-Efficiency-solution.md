# Solution 3 -Improve API efficiency

Duration: 50-60 Min

### Task 1: Install the necessary dependencies

Open your terminal, navigate to the root directory of your project (where package.json is located) and install the neccessary dependencies:

 - `@nestjs/graphql`
 - `@nestjs/apollo` 
 - `@apollo/server graphql`

### Task 2: Define GraphQL schemas (Code-First with auto-generated schema)

Open `app.module.ts` file and add the following code: 

    imports: [
    GraphQLModule.forRoot<ApolloDriverConfig>({
    driver: ApolloDriver,
    autoSchemaFile: true,})] 
    
    
 Your code should afterwards look like the image below

 In order to have nestjs auto-generate the schema we need to annotate each field in our entity (in this example "Movie") with a `field()` annotation.

### Task 3: Create resolvers

Create a new file named `app.resolver.ts` so you can write your queries and mutations.
