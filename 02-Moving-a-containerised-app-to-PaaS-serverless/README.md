# **02 Moving a containerised app to PaaS/serverless**

Introduction

The workshop provided by us aims towards providing Container App resource on Azure with test “hello world” docker image from internet.

Workshop consists of the deployment and presenting how serverless resources on Azure provides functionalization of the application without need to deploy it on multiple container orchestrator tools such as: Kubernetes cluster, docker swarm.

In this case we deployed only a simple application in one docker image to the container app and provide link to show the container runs automatically without prerequisites.

Requirements

Application deployment can be done successfully after receiving full control on Docker image repo credentials of the client.

Infrastructure Environment:

- Subscription to deploy resources
- Container App resource in Azure
- Docker image link user/password to add in resource

Main goals to achieve in this workshop:

1. Participating and working as a team with colleagues
2. Deploying docker image sample from internet in container app
3. Discussion with colleagues about benefits of serverless resources

Actions that we took to achieve goals:

1. [Find docker image sample from internet](#find-docker-image-sample-from-internet)
2. [Assign permissions to users joined in that tenant](#assign-permissions-to-users-joined-in-that-tenant)
3. [Create resource group](#create-resource-group)
4. [Create Azure Container App in Subscription and resource group that we created](#create-azure-container-app-in-subscription-and-resource-group-that-we-created)
5. [Configure Container App with image we found in internet](#configure-container-app-with-image-we-found-in-internet)
6. [Deploying demo container with link the resource provided to us](#deploying-demo-container-with-link-the-resource-provided-to-us)
